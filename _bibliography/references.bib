  abstract={We present Tesla-Rapture, a gesture recognition interface for point clouds generated by mmWave Radars. State of the art gesture recognition models are either too resource consuming or not sufficiently accurate for integration into real-life scenarios using wearable or constrained equipment such as IoT devices (e.g. Raspberry PI), XR hardware (e.g. HoloLens), or smart-phones. To tackle this issue, we developed Tesla, a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) graph convolution approach for mmWave radar point clouds. The model outperforms the state of the art on two datasets in terms of accuracy while reducing the computational complexity and, hence, the execution time. In particular, the approach, is able to predict a gesture almost 8 times faster than the most accurate competitor. Our performance evaluation in different scenarios (environments, angles, distances) shows that Tesla generalizes well and improves the accuracy up to 20% in challenging scenarios like a through-wall setting and sensing at extreme angles. Utilizing Tesla, we develop Tesla-Rapture, a real-time implementation using a mmWave Radar on a Raspberry PI 4 and evaluate its accuracy and time-complexity. We also publish the source code, the trained models, and the implementation of the model for embedded devices.},

  abstract={RF-sensing, the analysis and interpretation of movement or environment-induced patterns in received electromagnetic signals, has been actively investigated for more than a decade. Since electromagnetic signals, through cellular communication systems, are omnipresent, RF sensing has the potential to become a universal sensing mechanism with applications in smart home, retail, localization, gesture recognition, intrusion detection, etc. Specifically, existing cellular network installations might be dual-used for both communication and sensing. Such communications and sensing convergence is envisioned for future communication networks. We propose the use of NR-sidelink direct device-to-device communication to achieve device-initiated, flexible sensing capabilities beyond 5G cellular communication systems. In this article, we specifically investigate a common issue related to sidelink-based RF-sensing, which is its angle and rotation dependence. In particular, we discuss transformations of mmWave point-cloud data which achieve rotational invariance, as well as distributed processing based on such rotational invariant inputs, at angle and distance diverse devices. To process the distributed data, we propose a graph based encoder to capture spatio-temporal features of the data and propose four approaches for multi-angle learning. The approaches are compared on a newly recorded and openly available dataset comprising 15 subjects, performing 21 gestures which are recorded from 8 angles.

  abstract={The usage of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) in conjunction with Unmanned Ariel Vehicles (UAVs) is being investigated as a way to provide energy-efficient communication to ground users in dense urban areas. In this paper, we devise an optimization scenario to reduce overall energy consumption in the network while guaranteeing certain Quality of Service  (QoS) to the ground users in the area.
  Due to the complex nature of the optimization problem, we provide a joint UAV trajectory and RIS phase decision to minimize transmission power of the UAV and Base Station (BS) that yields good performance with lower complexity. So, the proposed method uses a Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) to iteratively determine a joint optimal solution for UAV Trajectory, RIS phase and BS and UAV Transmission Power. The approach has, therefore, been analytically evaluated under different sets of criterion.},

  abstract={Since electromagnetic signals are omnipresent, Radio Frequency (RF)-sensing has the potential to become a universal sensing mechanism with applications in localization, smart-home, retail, gesture recognition, intrusion detection, etc. Two emerging technologies in RF-sensing, namely sensing through Large Intelligent Surfaces (LISs) and mmWave Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radars, have been successfully applied to a wide range of applications. In this work, we compare LIS and mmWave radars for localization in real-world and simulated environments. In our experiments, the mmWave radar achieves 0.71 Intersection Over Union (IOU) and 3cm error for bounding boxes, while LIS has 0.56 IOU and 10cm distance error. Although the radar outperforms the LIS in terms of accuracy, LIS features additional applications in communication in addition to sensing scenarios.},

  abstract = {Text clustering and classification are two main tasks of text mining. Feature selection plays the key role in the quality of the clustering and classification results. Although word-based features such as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) vectors have been widely used in different applications, their shortcoming in capturing semantic concepts of text motivated researches to use semantic models for document vector representations. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling and doc2vec neural document embedding are two well-known techniques for this purpose. In this paper, we first study the conceptual difference between the two models and show that they have different behavior and capture semantic features of texts from different perspectives. We then proposed a hybrid approach for document vector representation to benefit from the advantages of both models. The experimental results on 20newsgroup show the superiority of the proposed model compared to each of the baselines on both text clustering and classification tasks. We achieved 2.6% improvement in F-measure for text clustering and 2.1% improvement in F-measure in text classification compared to the best baseline model.},

  abstract={We introduce Pantomime, a novel mid-air gesture recognition system exploiting spatio-temporal properties of millimeter-wave radio frequency (RF) signals. Pantomime is positioned in a unique region of the RF landscape: mid-resolution mid-range high-frequency sensing, which makes it ideal for motion gesture interaction. We configure a commercial frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar device to promote spatial information over the temporal resolution by means of sparse 3D point clouds and contribute a deep learning architecture that directly consumes the point cloud, enabling real-time performance with low computational demands. Pantomime achieves 95% accuracy and 99% AUC in a challenging set of 21 gestures articulated by 41 participants in two indoor environments, outperforming four state-of-the-art 3D point cloud recognizers. We further analyze the effect of the environment in 5 different indoor environments, the effect of articulation speed, angle, and the distance of the person up to 5m. We have publicly made available the collected mmWave gesture dataset consisting of nearly 22,000 gesture instances along with our radar sensor configuration, trained models, and source code for reproducibility. We conclude that pantomime is resilient to various input conditions and that it may enable novel applications in industrial, vehicular, and smart home scenarios.}

The architecture, PointGest, directly feeds on unprocessed timelines of point cloud data without any need for voxelization or projection. The model is resilient to noise in the input point cloud through abstraction to lower-density representations, especially for regions of high density. We evaluate the architecture on a benchmark dataset with ten gestures. PointGest achieves an accuracy of 98.8%, outperforming five state-of-the-art point cloud classification models.},

  abstract={Deep neural networks have been widely used in various language processing tasks. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) are two common types of neural networks that have a successful history in capturing temporal and spatial features of texts. By using RNN, we can encode input text to a lower space of semantic features while considering the sequential behavior of words. By using CNN, we can transfer the representation of input text to a flat structure to be used for classifying text. In this article, we proposed a novel recurrent CNN model to capture not only the temporal but also the spatial features of the input poem/verse to be used for poet identification. Considering the shortcomings of the normal RNNs, we try both long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit units in the proposed architecture and apply them to the poet identification task. There are a large number of poems in the history of literature whose poets are unknown. Considering the importance of the task in the information processing field, a great variety of methods from traditional learning models, such as support vector machine and logistic regression, to deep neural network models, such as CNN, have been proposed to address this problem. Our experiments show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models for poet identification by receiving either a poem or a single verse as input. In comparison to the state-of-the-art CNN model, we achieved 9% and 4% improvements in f-measure for poem- and verse-based tasks, respectively.}

We show that our approach can significantly increase the degree of FAIRness of the system by evaluating the architecture using existing maturity indicators in the literature. The proposed architecture successfully passes 18 maturity indicators out of 22.
